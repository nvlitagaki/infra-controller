//! Per-BMC admission: how many requests the proxy sends to each BMC at a
//! time, and which waiting request goes next.
//!
//! A request takes a slot at its BMC before it is sent when its class sets
//! `max_in_flight`, or when `[admission] max_in_flight_per_bmc` is set. It
//! holds the slot until the proxy has passed the BMC's response on to the
//! caller, or the exchange has failed, and for at most the bound its caller
//! gives from the grant on, after which the slot goes to the next waiting
//! request even if a caller that stopped reading still holds its response. A
//! request that finds no free slot waits in its class's queue at that BMC. A
//! freed slot goes to the highest-priority class that has a request waiting
//! and is under its own `max_in_flight`; classes of equal priority take
//! turns, and each class's requests go in the order they came. A request is
//! refused with `503` when its class's queue at that BMC is full of requests
//! still waiting, when no slot frees before its deadline, when the proxy
//! already tracks [`MAX_BMCS`] BMCs and this is another, or when the proxy is
//! shutting down. Limits are per proxy replica: with two replicas, a BMC can
//! receive twice a limit.
//!
//! Each BMC in use has its own `nv_redfish_dispatcher` runtime, driven by a
//! task of its own, as nico-api's admission drives one for its callers.
//! BMCs are independent, so no scheduling state is shared between them, and
//! scheduling a request touches only its own BMC's runtime. The dispatcher
//! never runs a request: for each request it runs a small grant that hands
//! the request its slot, then holds the BMC's capacity until the slot is
//! dropped or its time is up:
//!
//! ```text
//! Runtime (max_in_flight_per_bmc)        one per BMC in use
//! └─ StrictPriority                      by class priority
//!    └─ BoundedConcurrency(class max_in_flight)
//!       └─ BoundedQueue(class max_queued)  first come, first served
//! ```
