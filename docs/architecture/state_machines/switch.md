# Switch State Diagram

This document describes the Finite State Machine (FSM) for Switches in NICo:
lifecycle from creation through configuration, validation, ready, optional
rack-level reprovisioning, operator maintenance, decommissioning, and deletion.

## High-Level Overview

The main flow shows the primary states and transitions:

    state "Created" as Created
    state "Initializing (WaitForOsMachineInterface)" as Initializing
    state "Configuring" as Configuring
    state "FetchInfo" as FetchInfo

    state "Maintenance" as Maintenance
    state "ReProvisioning (rack-level)" as ReProvisioning
    state "Error" as Error
    state "Deleting" as Deleting

    [*] --> Created : Switch created

    Created --> Initializing : controller processes switch
    Initializing --> Configuring : all NVOS interfaces associated
    Initializing --> Error : no NVOS MACs or MAC conflict
    Configuring --> FetchInfo : certificate config and password rotation done
    FetchInfo --> Validating : slot and tray lookup complete
    Validating --> BomValidating : validation complete
    BomValidating --> Ready : BOM validation complete

    Ready --> Deleting : marked for deletion
    Ready --> Decommissioning : decommission requested
    Ready --> Maintenance : switch_maintenance_requested
    Ready --> ReProvisioning : rack-level switch_reprovisioning_requested

    Maintenance --> Ready : operation complete
    Maintenance --> Error : operation failed

    Error --> Deleting : marked for deletion
    Error --> Maintenance : switch_maintenance_requested

    ReProvisioning --> Ready : rack maintenance cycle complete
    ReProvisioning --> Error : firmware, NVOS, or fabric manager failure

    Decommissioning --> Decommissioned : factory reset and credential deletion complete
    Deleting --> [*] : final delete
```

## States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Created** | Switch record exists in NICo; awaiting first controller tick. |
| **Initializing** | Controller waits for expected switch NVOS MAC associations. Sub-state: `WaitForOsMachineInterface`. |
| **Configuring** | Switch is being configured. Sub-states: `ConfigureCertificate` (`Start` → `WaitForComplete { job_id }`), then `RotateOsPassword`. See [Switch Certificate Configuration](switch_configure_certificate.md). |
| **FetchInfo** | Controller fetches rack placement info (slot and tray) from the component manager backend and persists it on the switch record. Warn-and-continue on lookup failure. |
| **Validating** | Switch is being validated. Sub-state: `ValidationComplete`. |
| **BomValidating** | BOM (Bill of Materials) validation. Sub-state: `BomValidationComplete`. |
| **Ready** | Switch is ready for use. Can be deleted, enter decommissioning, enter operator maintenance, or enter rack-level reprovisioning. |
| **Decommissioning** | Switch is being removed from managed service. NICo suppresses discovery and DHCP, factory-resets NVOS and the BMC, and deletes managed credentials. Ends in terminal sub-state `Decommissioned`. |
| **Maintenance** | Operator-requested maintenance in progress. Operation is carried in `operation`: `PowerOn`, `PowerOff`, `Reset`, or `ReconfigureCertificate`. Certificate reconfiguration uses `configure_certificate` sub-states (`Start` → `WaitForComplete { job_id }`). |
| **ReProvisioning** | Rack-driven maintenance in progress. Sub-states: `WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`, `WaitingForNVOSUpgrade`, `WaitingForNMXCConfigure`. The rack state machine sets per-switch status fields and clears `switch_reprovisioning_requested` when the cycle completes. |
| **Error** | Switch is in error (for example firmware upgrade failed, certificate job failed, or NVOS MAC conflict). Can transition to `Deleting` or `Maintenance`; otherwise waits for manual intervention. |
| **Deleting** | Switch is being removed; ends in final delete (terminal). |

## Rack-Level Re-Provisioning

Rack maintenance drives switch reprovisioning by setting `switch_reprovisioning_requested` with an initiator prefixed `rack-`. The switch controller then walks these sub-states in order when `continue_after_firmware_upgrade` is true (the default):

```text
WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade -> WaitingForNVOSUpgrade -> WaitingForNMXCConfigure -> Ready
```

The rack state machine updates per-switch `firmware_upgrade_status`, `nvos_update_status`, and `fabric_manager_status` while the switch waits in each sub-state. If the parent rack enters `Error`, the switch aborts reprovisioning and returns to `Ready`.

## On-Demand Maintenance Operations

The `Maintenance` state is entered when `switch_maintenance_requested` is posted (from `Ready` or `Error`). Supported operations:

- **PowerOn** — powers the switch on via the component manager.
- **PowerOff** — powers the switch off.
- **Reset** — force-restarts the switch.
- **ReconfigureCertificate** — reinstalls or rotates NVOS mTLS certificates via component manager / RMS. Uses the same async certificate flow as bring-up; see [Switch Certificate Configuration](switch_configure_certificate.md).

## Decommissioning

Managed-switch decommissioning requires the RMS switch backend and starts only
from `Ready`. After Site Explorer acknowledges suppression, the controller
submits the NVOS factory reset, persists the returned job ID, and polls that
job until RMS reports `Completed`. It then suppresses NVOS DHCP, requests a
switch reboot through Redfish, and waits for DHCP suppression acknowledgement
before resetting the BMC and deleting managed credentials.

Transient handler errors leave the switch in its current sub-state for a
later retry. A failed RMS reset job reports `ManualInterventionRequired`
while retaining the job ID in `WaitingForNvosFactoryReset`. An ambiguous
submission outcome enters `NvosFactoryResetOutcomeUnknown`, which requires
operator recovery and does not automatically resubmit the reset.

Refer to
[Decommission Managed Switches](../../decommissioning/switches.md) for the
operator procedure and intended post-reset state.

## Implementation

- **State type**: `SwitchControllerState` in `crates/api-model/src/switch/mod.rs`.
- **Handlers**: `crates/switch-controller/src/` — one module per top-level state (`created`, `initializing`, `configuring`, `fetch_info`, `validating`, `bom_validating`, `ready`, `decommissioning`, `maintenance`, `reprovisioning`, `error_state`, `deleting`).
- **Certificate configuration design**: [switch_configure_certificate.md](switch_configure_certificate.md).
- **Orchestration**: `SwitchStateHandler` in `handler.rs` delegates to the handler for the current `controller_state`.
